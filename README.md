# 🚀 Developer Journey — Adaptive Learning Curriculum

This repository documents my development as a **full-stack engineer** and **systems thinker** with the ability to build and understand Web2 and Web3 applications from first principles.

It contains:
- A complete **adaptive learning curriculum**
- All **projects** created during each phase
- **Design docs**, **reflections**, and **engineering notes**
- A public, ongoing portfolio of my technical growth

This repo serves as both a **learning environment** and a **professional showcase**.

# 🧭 Purpose

This repository is designed to help me:

### **1. Build full-stack engineering skills from first principles**
Covering frontend, backend, systems, databases, infrastructure, and Web3.

### **2. Develop real engineering workflows**
Documentation, testing, architecture, abstractions, Git, and tooling.

### **3. Learn to think in systems**
How components interact, scale, fail, and stabilize.

### **4. Build Web3 competence progressively**
Blockchain concepts introduced early and expanded across multiple phases.

### **5. Maintain a public technical portfolio**
Every project is versioned, documented, and improved over time.

# 🧠 Curriculum Overview

The curriculum (see `/docs/curriculum/`) includes:

### ✔ Phase 0 — Computational Intuition + Web3 Mental Models
### ✔ Phase 1 — JavaScript Foundations
### ✔ Phase 2 — TypeScript + Abstraction + Software Design
### ✔ Phase 2.5 — Databases + Persistence
### ✔ Phase 3 — Systems Thinking + Cybernetics + Async
### ✔ Phase 4 — Backend Engineering + API Design
### ✔ Phase 5 — Smart Contracts + EVM + Web3 Engineering
### ✔ Phase 6 — Full-Stack Web2/Web3 Capstone

Each phase contains:
- learning goals
- conceptual frameworks
- micro-projects
- a main project
- Web3 extensions
- reflection prompts
- monthly spiral review

# 🧩 Getting Started

Begin here:
**➡ `/docs/curriculum/phase_0.md`**

Each project has a corresponding folder under:
`/projects/phase_X/`

# 🧠 How to Learn Effectively

**Before you start any learning session**, read the Daily Learning Protocol:
**➡ `/docs/support/daily_learning_protocol.md`**

This 8-step protocol helps you:
- Stay focused and avoid overwhelm
- Build momentum through micro-goals
- Maintain continuity across sessions
- Develop computational intuition through reflection

Use it for every session, even if you only have 15 minutes.
