# 🧠 Daily Learning Protocol

Use this protocol for *every* learning session, regardless of phase.
It keeps you focused, reduces overwhelm, and ensures consistent progress.

---

## 1. Open the Phase Document (2 minutes)
- Read the *current task* you're working on.
- Do **not** reread the whole phase.
- Do **not** try to remember everything.
Just orient yourself.

**Ask:**
"What is the next smallest step?"

---

## 2. Warm-Up Check (3 minutes)
- Skim yesterday's notes or last commit.
- If nothing comes to mind, look at your `/reflections` file.
- Rebuild the mental context.

**Ask:**
"What was I in the middle of?"

---

## 3. Set a Micro-Goal (1–2 sentences)
Examples:
- "Implement add() before worrying about update()."
- "Get the API route returning *anything*."
- "Write one test for one function."
- "Create the contract file and compile it."

**Rule:**
A micro-goal must be doable in 10–45 minutes.

---

## 4. Work in a 20–40 Minute Focus Block
- Build one tiny vertical slice.
- Use fast feedback: console logs, tests, local scripts.
- Commit often.

**Tips:**
- Write pseudocode if stuck.
- Break logic into tiny functions.
- Reduce scope until you can proceed.

---

## 5. Quick Debug Loop (If Needed)
If you get stuck:
- Add a print/log.
- Predict what should happen.
- Run it.
- Compare with reality.

**Ask:**
"What is one thing I can test right now?"

This builds computational intuition.

---

## 6. Close the Loop (5 minutes)
Write a short entry in `/reflections`:

- What I did
- What confused me
- What I learned
- What future-me should remember

**Do not write more than 5–6 sentences.
Do not edit or polish.**
Raw is better.

---

## 7. Set Tomorrow's First Step (1 sentence)
Examples:
- "Tomorrow: write the fetchTasks() function."
- "Next session: connect the contract to Hardhat tests."
- "Next: add validation middleware."

This eliminates startup friction.

---

## 8. Commit + Stop (2 minutes)
- Commit your work.
- Push if needed.
- Close your editor.

The goal is **closure, not perfection**.

# 🔁 Summary Checklist

- [ ] Orient (phase → task)
- [ ] Recall (yesterday's work)
- [ ] Set micro-goal
- [ ] Focus block
- [ ] Debug loop
- [ ] Reflect

- Prevents overwhelm
- Keeps tasks small and winnable
- Creates momentum
- Supports spiral learning
- Maintains continuity across sessions

Use this every time you sit down — even for 15 minutes.
